[2025-10-17 21:44:43] [LLM_SUMMARY]
I will create a minimal 'Hello World' GUI application using Python's built-in Tkinter library. First, I will validate that Python is installed, then create a source directory and the main application file. Finally, I will submit the command to run the application.

[2025-10-17 21:44:52] [LLM_SUMMARY]
The previous attempt to validate the Python installation failed because the `python` command was not found. I will now ask you to ensure Python is installed and accessible via the system's PATH environment variable before I can proceed.

My apologies, the `REQUEST_USER_INPUT` task was not recognized. The initial error was that the `python` command was not found. On Windows, the `py` launcher is often available. I will now retry the plan using `py` instead of `python` to validate the installation and run the application.

Python installation has been successfully verified using the `py` command. I will now proceed with the original plan to create the 'Hello World' GUI application by creating the source directory, writing the application code, and submitting the run command.

I will remove the 'Close' button from the Python Tkinter application by modifying the `src/main.py` file.
